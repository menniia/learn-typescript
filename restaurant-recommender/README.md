# Restaurant Order System

This is a TypeScript-based project that models a simple restaurant order system. The project includes functionality for filtering and displaying restaurant orders based on price brackets.

The system consists of:

- A list of restaurants, each with their specific delivery times and price brackets.
- A list of orders, with each order containing a name and a price.
- A function that filters orders based on a specified price bracket.
- A function that prints out the orders of each restaurant.

## Features

- **Price Brackets**: Orders are grouped by price brackets: Low, Medium, and High.
- **Filtering Orders**: Orders can be filtered based on a price bracket, showing only those that fit within the selected bracket.
- **Display Orders**: Orders for each restaurant are displayed, including the order name and price.
