# TypeMart - TypeScript Learning Project

Welcome to **TypeMart**! This is a small TypeScript project where I’m learning how to use TypeScript types while building a basic online store. The goal of this project is to practice applying types while managing product information, calculating prices, shipping fees, and taxes.

## What’s This About?

In this project, I have a list of products, and I’m calculating the total cost for a customer based on:

1. Product price
2. Pre-order status
3. Shipping cost (free for products over GH₵25)
4. Tax based on shipping location

I’m also learning how to use TypeScript’s type system to make sure everything works safely and correctly!

## Features

- **Product List**: A small selection of products, each with a name, price, and pre-order status.
- **Shipping**: Calculated based on the price of the product.
- **Tax**: Different tax rates for Accra vs. other locations.
- **Pre-order Handling**: If a product is a pre-order, the user gets a message.

## Learning Focus

This project is all about using TypeScript types. I’m using types for:

- **Product information**
- **Variables** like shipping cost, tax, and total amount
- Ensuring everything works type-safely without errors.
